						I am an undergraduate at the University of Toronto currently studying computer science. I knew I wanted to study computer science after
						taking it for the first time in high school. Since then, I have developed many side projects both in groups and on my own and are listed
						below.
						Outside of school, I enjoy playing ice hockey and am I Leafs fan. Additionaly, I work part time as a math and physics tutor and play the piano 
						in my free time.

						Long term goal: Get a job as a senior software developer

                    At GoodStudy Tutoring I tutored students from grades 9-12 in mathematics and physics. I started in September and tutored
					students regularly every week. I helped students struggling with math and physics improve there grades by helping them
					through there homework and correcting their homework. While tutoring I improved my ability to break down and 
					explain complex ideas while teaching to students.

                            After graduating high school, four friends and I were interested in devloping a mobile app. After some brainstorming, we decided
							we wanted to make a game and were tasked with developing an enjoyable game with a professional look. We decided the best way to accomplish
							this was using the the Unity Physics Engine. In addition, we used GitHub for version control and had frequent scrums to create the game. By
							the end of the three months, we had a finished project that we uploaded to the Google Play Store. While working on this project I learned 
							how to efficiently develop software in groups. I also learned more about the software development process as our expectations of the game 
							changed as we worked on the game.

                            In highschool, we were given an assignment where we had to develop a game using Java in groups. We started
							the project by planning the game using a game design document and a complete UML diagram. After the planning was
							complete, we agreed to make a farming similar. Over the course of two months we devloped the game and was awarded
							"Game of the Semester" by the teacher. This was my first major programming assignment and it taught me a lot about
							software development.
